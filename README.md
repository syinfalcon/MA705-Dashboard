# MA705 Final Project - Cause of Death Dashboard

This repository contains files used in the MA705 dashboard project.

## Dashboard Description

The dashboard summarizes the information of the number of deaths caused by different reasons during four years obtained from the Data.CDC.gov website.
There is one bar chart and two tables in this dashboard.

Bar chart:
- x axis shows the time by year
- y axis shows the number of deaths per 1,000,000 residents
- y label shows the causes of death
- the color of the bar chart shows different states
- this bar chart is affected by states and the cause of death

Table 1:
- it solves the question that which state has the highest average number of deaths per 1,000,000 residents caused by the reason selected
- Table 1 is only affected by the cause of death

Table 2:
- it shows the average number of deaths per 1,000,000 residents with different causation in each state you selected
- Table 2 is only affected by states
